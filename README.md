# car-simulator

A realistic passenger-car driving simulator set in a fictional Czech landscape, written in
C++23 on the **XNA 4.0-compatible public API** of the [CNA](https://github.com/libcna/cna)
framework (branch `next`) and [Sharp Runtime](https://github.com/libcna/sharp-runtime)
(branch `next`).

There are no jobs, missions, deliveries or economy. You start a car, drive through a Czech
town and the villages around it, the countryside and a forest, meet traffic, and enjoy driving
-- at any hour and in any weather.

multisampling); `scripts/capture_set.sh` reproduces the whole set.

## Status

Everything listed below is implemented and is the accepted scope of the project. Known
limitations, what is deliberately out of scope and sensible next steps are in
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). How to build, test and change the code without breaking its
constraints is in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Development up to September 2026 was
tracked in a phase-by-phase task ledger with acceptance evidence (screenshots, measurements,
listening packs); those were retired from the tree and remain in git history.

Developer memory checks use the project-only `asan-ubsan` preset described in
[`docs/sanitizers.md`](docs/sanitizers.md). GPU measurements on an AMD Radeon 780M, their
limits and how to reproduce them are in [`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md).

What you get today:

- One drivable car, the fictional **Lipan 1.2** (a small four-cylinder hatchback defined in
  `content/vehicles/lipan_12.json`), with a project-owned rigid-body, suspension, tyre,
  engine, clutch, manual and automatic gearbox, fuel, thermal and electrical simulation. Turbo,
  ultra turbo and ultra ultra turbo are intentional optional modes; the ordinary car remains the
  baseline. A helicopter mode and an on-foot exploration mode are also available.
- One map, a 6.4 x 7.6 km region around the town of **Lipová**: a cobbled square with the
  church, a memorial column, town houses and parked cars, a prefab estate, shops, a filling
  station on the eastern approach, bus stops and a wayside chapel at the signalised eastern
  junction; residential streets with fenced and planted gardens and cars parked at the kerb.
  Four more places on the roads out of it -- the street village of **Březí**, the village of
  **Podhájí** on the southern ring, the small town of **Nové Město** in the north-east with its
  own square, and the hamlet of **Kamenice** in the western hills -- plus tree avenues, fields,
  meadows and a forest with a gravel forest track. West of the town the medieval castle
  **Hrad Lipník** stands on a wooded hill, reached by a 2 km gravel track that winds up through
  the forest and once round the walls to the gatehouse. About 27 km of roads, 22 intersections,
  Czech traffic signs and road markings.
- Cockpit camera with a live instrument cluster, rotating steering wheel, a working rear-view
  mirror and live wing mirrors; exterior chase camera.
- Ambient traffic with Czech registration plates that follows lanes, keeps distance, obeys
  priority, yield, stop, the right-hand rule and working traffic signals, and reacts to the
  player; buses and box lorries that keep to 80 km/h, prefer the through route, have a
  junction to themselves and make oncoming cars wait in tight bends, buses that call at the
  stops, and cars that overtake a slow lorry or a bus at a stop when the other lane is clear; cars parked on the town
  square that are as solid as any other obstacle; people on the pavements of the town and the
  villages who cross at the zebra crossings (and, now and then, where they please) once nothing
  is coming, and whom the traffic stops for.
- A day and night cycle with a real solar path, street lamps, lit windows and headlamp pools
  after dark, and weather -- clear, scattered cloud, overcast, rain, fog or snow, with wet roads
  that take a third off the grip, snow that settles on fields, roads and roofs and halves it, puddles, tyre spray, a darker and glossier wet world, raindrops on the
  windscreen and wipers.
- Physical collisions with buildings, street furniture, trees and traffic cars; hard knocks dent
  the body where it was hit and break the lamps (`Backspace` puts the car back on the road repaired).
- Listener-selected CC0 Honda Civic startup/idle and Mini Cooper S load recordings blended
  with RPM-driven engine synthesis; tyre and wind noise, indicators,
  horn, gear and impact sounds; tyre tread and scrub respond to rough ground, snow and slip,
  nearby traffic contributes spatially placed engine sound, and helicopter mode has its own
  rotor and turbine layer.
- Persistent odometer, trip, transmission mode and settings; key bindings configurable in the
  save file; in-game help and debug overlays.

Not included (by design or deferred, see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)): mechanical damage,
real-brand car models (no legally redistributable Škoda
model was available; the car is procedural).

## Requirements

- CMake 3.23+, Ninja (recommended), a C++23 compiler (GCC 13+, Clang 18+, MSVC 19.38+),
  Python 3 for the tools and static checks.
- Sibling checkouts (the build consumes them with `add_subdirectory()`):
  - `../cna` -- CNA, branch **`next`**, with submodules `third_party/SDL`,
    `third_party/SDL_mixer` and `vendor/googletest`.
  - `../sharp-runtime` -- Sharp Runtime, branch **`next`**.
  - `../cna-engine` -- cna-engine, branch **`develop`**: its strict modules carry the input
    actions, the physics clock, screenshots, caches, quality tiers, the world renderer and the
    textures' mip levels and uploads.
  - `../easy-gl` and `../meta-gl` when building the OpenGL family renderers (`OPENGLES3`, the
    Linux default, `OPENGL33`, ...).
- Linux packages for SDL3 (X11/Wayland development headers, ALSA/PulseAudio) and OpenGL
  ES/EGL development headers for the GL renderers.

## Building

```bash
git clone --branch next https://github.com/libcna/cna.git
git -C cna submodule update --init third_party/SDL third_party/SDL_mixer vendor/googletest
git clone --branch next https://github.com/libcna/sharp-runtime.git
git clone --branch develop https://github.com/libcna/cna-engine.git
git clone https://github.com/libcna/easy-gl.git
git clone https://github.com/libcna/meta-gl.git
git clone https://github.com/libcna/car-simulator.git
cd car-simulator
cmake --preset opengles3          # or: default, opengl33, vulkan, software, debug
cmake --build --preset opengles3 -j
ctest --preset opengles3
./build/opengles3/bin/car-simulator
```

Pass `-DCARSIM_CNA_ROOT=/path/to/cna -DCARSIM_SHARP_RUNTIME_ROOT=/path/to/sharp-runtime
-DCARSIM_CNA_ENGINE_ROOT=/path/to/cna-engine` when the checkouts are elsewhere. The renderer is CNA's `CNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER` option; the
simulator never depends on which renderer was selected and `CNA_CNAEXT` stays `OFF`.

The content directory is copied next to the executable after each build; the source
`content/` directory is used as a fallback during development.

Headless smoke run (Xvfb, dummy audio) as used by the tests and for screenshots:

```bash
scripts/run_headless.sh ./build/opengles3/bin/car-simulator --frames 60 --screenshot shot.png
scripts/capture_set.sh                      # the whole curated set in docs/screenshots/
scripts/benchmark_suite.sh --quick          # the eight benchmark scenes
python3 scripts/benchmark_report.py build/benchmarks --label "this machine"
```

### Measuring and validating

`--route <name>` drives one of the routes defined in `content/maps/lipova/traffic.json` with an
autopilot that follows the lane graph through the ordinary physics -- nothing is teleported -- so a
run is repeatable to the metre. `scripts/benchmark_suite.sh` uses that to run eight deterministic
scenes (clear day, rain, clear night, rainy night, each from the exterior and the cockpit) and
`scripts/benchmark_report.py` turns them into the tables in
[`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md), with `--against` for a before-and-after comparison.
`F3` opens the diagnostic overlay: frames per second with the worst 1 %, the update and draw
halves split by stage and by pass, the mirror's cost and resolution, the weather and sun state,
drawn-against-culled batch counts, and live engine mix inputs and coefficients when audio is
enabled.

## Controls

Defaults from `Input::InputMapper`; the in-game help (`F1`) always shows the live bindings.

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Accelerator / brake while driving | `W` / `S` (also `Up` / `Down`) |
| Steer left / right | `A` / `D` (also `Left` / `Right`) |
| Clutch (manual mode) | `Q` |
| Handbrake | `Space` |
| Engine start / stop (one press; the starter cranks until the engine catches) | `E` |
| Cycle off / turbo / ultra turbo / ultra ultra turbo (about 250 / 400 / 500 km/h) | `O` |
| Gear up / selector up, gear down / selector down | `Left Shift` / `Left Ctrl` (also right-hand keys) |
| Manual gears | `1` .. `6`, `N` neutral, `R` reverse |
| Automatic selector | `P` park, `R` reverse, `N` neutral, `F` drive |
| Toggle automatic / manual | `T` |
| Differential open / limited slip (`LSD` on the HUD) | `U` |
| Automatic clutch for the manual gearbox (`AUTO CLUTCH` on the HUD) | `Z` |
| Wipers off / intermittent / slow / fast | `I` |
| Indicators left / right, hazard (they switch themselves off when the wheel returns after a turn) | `,` / `.` / `H` |
| Headlights on / off; switch low / high beam | `L`; `K` (also turns on high beam directly) |
| Horn | `B` |
| Camera cockpit / exterior | `C` |
| Toggle full screen | `F11` (or start with `--fullscreen`) |
| Show / hide map | `M` |
| Exhaust smoke on / off | `X` |
| Car / helicopter | `J` |
| Helicopter: forward / back, turn, climb / descend; short / long searchlight | `W` / `S`, `A` / `D`, `Space` / `Q`; `K` |
| Enter walking mode from a stopped car with the engine off; return to car | `G` |
| On foot: forward / back, turn, sidestep, toggle run | `Up` / `Down`, `Left` / `Right`, `A` / `D`, either `Shift` |
| Rear-view mirror on / off, HUD text on / off | `V`, `Tab` |
| Master volume | `Page Up` / `Page Down` |
| Reset vehicle to the road, reset trip meter | `Backspace`, `F5` |
| Clock back / forward an hour, freeze the clock | `F6` / `F7`, `F8` |
| Next weather (clear, cloud, overcast, rain, fog, snow) | `F4` |
| Help overlay, debug overlay, screenshot | `F1`, `F3`, `F12` |
| Quit | `Esc` |

Walking uses a first-person view and audible footsteps at 6 km/h; running is 16 km/h.
The parked car must have its engine off before `G` enters walking mode. `G` cannot
switch to walking from the helicopter. Cars stop for a person on their path, and
the walker cannot move through parked or moving cars.

The running car emits exhaust smoke from its tailpipe. Press `X` to hide or show it;
the choice is saved in the profile.

In ultra ultra turbo, steering remains effective at high speed while the turn
radius widens to keep the car stable. Slow down before a tight corner at very high speed.

Driving notes: the engine has to be started with `E`; the starter only engages in neutral,
with the clutch pressed, or with the automatic selector in `P` or `N`, and it cranks for a
moment before the engine catches. In manual mode releasing the clutch below the stall speed
or at standstill in gear stalls the engine; in automatic mode the car creeps in `D`. The fuel gauge lamp lights on reserve; when
the fuel drops to half of the reserve amount the tank is refilled to 100 % (both fractions are
vehicle-definition parameters, `fuel.refillAtReserveFraction` and `fuel.refillToFraction`).

### Gamepad and steering wheel

The first game controller (XNA `GamePad`, player one) works alongside the keyboard; whichever
asks for more throttle, brake or steering wins. A controller that reports itself as a wheel
(`GamePadType::Wheel`) steers linearly, a gamepad's stick is curved for fine control near the
centre. With a controller connected, `F1` shows its buttons.

| Control | Gamepad | Wheel |
|---|---|---|
| Steer | left stick | wheel |
| Accelerate / brake | `RT` / `LT` | accelerator / brake pedal |
| Gear up / down (manual), selector up / down (automatic) | `RB` / `LB` | right / left paddle |
| Clutch (held), handbrake | `X`, `B` | `X`, `B` |
| Drive (automatic), camera | `A`, `Y` | `A`, `Y` |
| Engine start / stop, automatic / manual | `Start`, `Back` | `Start`, `Back` |
| Indicators left / right, headlights, horn | D-pad left / right / up / down | D-pad |
| High beam, hazard | left / right stick click | |

The controller vibrates with wheelspin or a locked wheel, the ABS, gravel and grass, and on
impacts. Controller buttons are fixed; the keyboard bindings stay configurable.

## Save file and settings

Odometer, trip, transmission mode, the last vehicle and map, and settings are stored as JSON
(schema 1) in `$CARSIM_SAVE_DIR/save.json`, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/car-simulator/save.json`
(`%APPDATA%\car-simulator\save.json` on Windows, `~/.local/share/...` as the fallback).
The file is written atomically every 30 s and on exit; a file with a newer schema is opened
read-only. Fields have been added over time (the clock and the weather in Phase 12, the graphics
tier in Phase 13) without a schema bump: they are additive with defaults, an older build ignores
keys it does not know, and a test loads a profile written before any of them existed and checks
nothing is lost. Settings and bindings can be edited by hand:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "odometerKm": 12.4, "tripKm": 3.1, "transmissionMode": "manual",
  "vehicleId": "lipan_12", "mapId": "lipova",
  "settings": {
    "masterVolume": 0.8, "engineVolume": 1.0, "effectsVolume": 1.0,
    "mirrorEnabled": true, "hudVisible": true, "startInCockpit": false,
    "timeOfDayHours": 10.5, "timeScale": 60.0, "weather": "few-clouds",
    "graphicsQuality": "high", "mirrorUpdateEvery": 1
  },
  "bindings": [
    { "action": "Horn", "key": "Enter" },
    { "action": "ToggleCamera", "key": "V" }
  ]
}
```

Action names are the `GameAction` enumerators (`Throttle`, `Brake`, `SteerLeft`,
`SteerRight`, `Clutch`, `Handbrake`, `Horn`, `ToggleEngine`, `ToggleTurbo`, `ShiftUp`, `ShiftDown`,
`GearNeutral`, `GearReverse`, `Gear1` .. `Gear6`, `SelectorPark`, `SelectorDrive`,
`ToggleTransmission`, `ToggleDifferential`, `ToggleAutoClutch`, `IndicatorLeft`, `IndicatorRight`, `Hazard`, `Headlights`, `HighBeam`, `CycleWipers`,
`ToggleCamera`, `ToggleFullscreen`, `ToggleMap`, `ToggleFlight`, `ToggleWalk`, `ToggleRun`, `ToggleHelp`, `ToggleDebug`, `Screenshot`, `ResetVehicle`, `ResetTrip`,
`Quit`, `VolumeUp`, `VolumeDown`, `ToggleMirror`, `ToggleHud`); key names are the ones the
help overlay prints (`A`..`Z`, `0`..`9`, `F1`..`F12`, `Space`, `Left Shift`, `Page Up`, ...).
Unknown names are reported as warnings and ignored. An override replaces the default keys of
that action.

Two static libraries keep the renderer-free code testable: `carsim_core` (Core, Sim, Map,
Collision, Traffic, engine synthesis; depends only on CNA's math/core headers and Sharp
Runtime's JSON) and `carsim_render` (everything that touches `GraphicsDevice`, audio devices
and input). The executable is a thin `Game` subclass.

Simulation runs in fixed 120 Hz sub-steps inside `Vehicle::Update`; traffic, collision and
audio mixing run at the frame rate. Coordinates are right-handed, +Y up, north = -Z.

Phase 14 kept the existing `Vehicle`, `TrafficSystem`, `WorldRenderer` and
`SimulatorGame` entry points while moving coherent responsibilities into their
own implementation files: vehicle flight and wheel updates, traffic spawning,
junctions, spatial queries and overtaking, world geometry and scenery, and game
overlays. The engine recording and rotor DSP live in `carsim_core`; the XNA
audio stream stays in `carsim_render`. The resulting ownership is reflected in
`simulator/CMakeLists.txt` and keeps simulation tests independent of a renderer.

### API boundary

Application code uses CNA only through the XNA 4.0 surface (`Microsoft::Xna::Framework::*`)
plus Sharp Runtime. CNAEXT, renderer implementation classes, renderer-specific includes and
platform libraries are prohibited. `scripts/check_xna_only.py` enforces this as the
`xna_only_api_check` CTest against a list of the XNA 4.0 public types; the reasoning and the
observed renderer behaviours that shaped the code (for example, untextured lit `BasicEffect`
rendering black on the OPENGLES3 renderer, so every lit material is textured) are recorded in
[`docs/api-boundary.md`](docs/api-boundary.md) and
[`docs/framework-findings.md`](docs/framework-findings.md).

Missing XNA functionality is implemented in project code: bitmap fonts drawn with
`SpriteBatch` from pre-rasterised atlases, procedural textures with CPU mip chains, planar
stencil shadows via `Matrix::CreateShadow`, environment-mapped paint through
`EnvironmentMapEffect`, terrain macro lighting baked into a `DualTextureEffect` texture, the
mirror and the instrument cluster as `RenderTarget2D` passes.

### Vehicles are data

A vehicle definition (`content/vehicles/*.json`, schema 1) holds chassis mass, dimensions,
inertia and drag, wheel positions, suspension, tyre (combined-slip, load-sensitive) parameters,
steering geometry, engine (idle/redline/limiter, inertia, friction, torque curve, starter,
thermal and consumption model), clutch, gearbox (ratios, final drive, automatic shift map),
fuel tank and refill rule, indicator period, visual placement (driver eye, steering wheel,
mirror, cluster, paint, plate) and dashboard ranges. `docs/vehicle-physics.md` documents the
model and its compromises; `tools/simtrace` prints acceptance drives.

### Maps are data

Maps are JSON source files with a versioned schema (`map.json`, `terrain.json`, `roads.json`,
`objects.json`, `traffic.json`); road centrelines, intersection patches, lanes, connectors,
conflicts and right of way, terrain conformance, buildings, props, signs and vegetation are
derived deterministically at load time. [`docs/map-format.md`](docs/map-format.md) has the
format decision and schema reference. The sample map is generated by the two-stage pipeline
`tools/maps/build_map.py` and committed as generated output
([`docs/map-generation.md`](docs/map-generation.md)); `carsim-mapvalidate` (CTest
`map_validate_lipova`) validates any map, and CTest `map_regeneration_check` fails if the
committed map and its generator drift apart.

### Traffic

Cars follow lane and connector polylines with the Intelligent Driver Model, respect speed
limits and curve speeds, indicate before turns, come to a full stop at stop signs, apply
priority / yield / right-hand rule and left-turn-yields-to-oncoming from the lane graph,
accept gaps by time to arrival, keep junction boxes clear, and treat a car whose body lies on
their path as an obstacle. A deadlock breaker releases the longest-waiting car when nothing
moves, and a nose-to-nose stand-off inside a junction is resolved by the yielding car backing
out to its line. Plates come from a generator that follows the Czech `1A2 3456` series with
regional letter weights (`docs/research/czech-plates.md`). A traffic car queues behind a
player who stops in the lane; it does not overtake.
It may pass slower AI traffic on clear two-lane roads after checking the full passing and
return path against authored centre-line ranges, oncoming traffic, junctions, crossings,
curvature and weather clearance. The restricted stretch near E3 also has B 21a/B 21b roadside
plates in both directions, with B 21a repeated after the junction.

Traffic continues beneath an airborne helicopter; the helicopter still collides with car
bodies when it actually touches them.

## Testing

```bash
ctest --preset opengles3                  # everything below
ctest --preset opengles3 -L unit          # GoogleTest suites (no display needed)
ctest --preset opengles3 -L static        # XNA-only API check, asset manifest check
ctest --preset opengles3 -L content       # sample map validation and map-generation consistency
ctest --preset opengles3 -L display       # headless smoke run through scripts/run_headless.sh
```

The unit binary `carsim_tests` covers the vehicle model (engine states, clutch stall, gear
logic, fuel refill rule, thermal, odometer, determinism, acceleration and braking bands, a
constant-speed fuel cycle), wet braking, cornering and acceleration measured against dry, map
loading and validation, road and lane graph geometry (turn types, right of way, antisymmetric
yields, routes), terrain/ground agreement over every lane and junction connector, collision
shapes and scenarios, traffic (IDM, following, intersections, spawning, a 30-minute soak with no
body overlaps or stuck cars and a 10-minute soak at the signalised junction with no red-light
crossings), the autopilot driving every benchmark route of the shipped map end to end, plates,
engine synthesis, graphics tiers and save data, including a profile written by an earlier phase.

## Performance

On an AMD Radeon 780M (Mesa `radeonsi`, OPENGLES3, 1280 × 720) the clear-town project draw
submission is about 10.5 ms from the chase camera and 16.3 ms from the cockpit, of which the
rear and wing mirrors take about 5 ms; the update half averages about 1 ms. Culling a wing
mirror whose glass is out of view removes about 162 indexed 3D draws and 388,000 triangles per
frame in the rainy-night cockpit with an identical image. Three graphics tiers
(`--quality low|medium|high`, `settings.graphicsQuality`) trade
draw distance, vegetation distance and mirror rate; `high` is the default and is what every
picture and table was taken at. Per-scene tables, budgets and the commands that reproduce them
are in [`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md); `--benchmark-json` writes them as JSON.
The same scenes were built and compared on the OPENGLES3, OPENGL33, SOFTWARE and Vulkan renderers
([`docs/renderer-conformance.md`](docs/renderer-conformance.md)), and
[`docs/real-hardware-validation.md`](docs/real-hardware-validation.md) describes reproduction
on a real PC with a GPU.
